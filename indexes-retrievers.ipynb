    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, indexes and retrievers play a crucial role in structuring documents and fetching relevant data for LLMs.  We will explore some of the advantages and disadvantages of using document based LLMs (i.e., LLMs that leverage relevant pieces of documents inside their prompts), with a particular focus on the role of indexes and retrievers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An index is a powerful data structure that meticulously organizes and stores documents to enable efficient searching, while a retriever harnesses the index to locate and return pertinent documents in response to user queries. Within LangChain, the primary index types are centered on vector databases, with embeddings-based indexes being the most prevalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrievers focus on extracting relevant documents to merge with prompts for language models. A retriever exposes a get_relevant_documents method, which accepts a query string as input and returns a list of related documents."
