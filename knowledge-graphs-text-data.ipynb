    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, understanding the relationships between different pieces of information is crucial. Knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful way to visualize and explore these connections, transforming unstructured text into a structured network of entities and their relationships. We will guide you through a simple workflow for creating a knowledge graph from textual data, making complex information more accessible and easier to understand.\n",

    "## Knowledge Graphs and Knowledge Bases: know the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving deep into our main topic, it's important to have a clear understanding of the difference between Knowledge Graphs and Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms \"knowledge graph\" and \"knowledge base\" are often used interchangeably, but they have subtle differences. Knowledge base (KB) refers to structured information that we have about a domain of interest. On the other hand, a knowledge graph is a knowledge base structured as a graph, where nodes represent entities and edges signify relations between those entities. For example, from the text “Fabio lives in Italy,” we can extract the relation triplet <Fabio, lives in, Italy>, where “Fabio” and “Italy” are entities, and “lives in” it’s their relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph is a particular type of knowledge base. A knowledge base is not necessarily a knowledge graph."

    "## Building a Knowledge Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of building a knowledge graph usually consists of two sequential steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER): This step involves extracting entities from the text, which will eventually become the nodes of the knowledge graph.\n",
    "Relation Classification (RC): In this step, relations between entities are extracted, forming the edges of the knowledge graph.\n",
    "Then, the knowledge graph is commonly visualized using libraries such as pyvis .\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the process of creating a knowledge base from the text can be enhanced by incorporating additional steps, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity Linking: This involves normalizing entities to the same entity, such as “Napoleon” and “Napoleon Bonapart.” This is usually done by linking them to a canonical source, like a Wikipedia page.\n",
    "Source Tracking: Keeping track of the origin of each relation, such as the article URL and text span. Keeping track of the sources allows us to gather insights into the reliability of the extracted information (e.g., a relation is accurate if it can be extracted from several sources considered accurate).\n",
    "In this project, we’ll do the Named Entity Recognition and Relation Classification tasks simultaneously with an appropriate prompt. This joint task is commonly called Relation Extraction (RE)."

    "## Building a Knowledge Graph with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate an example of using a prompt to extract relations from the text in LangChain, we can use the following  KNOWLEDGE_TRIPLE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT prompt as a starting point. This prompt is designed to extract knowledge triples (subject, predicate, and object) from a given text input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt can be used by the ConversationEntityMemory class from LangChain library, which is a way for chatbots to keep a memory of the past messages of a conversation by storing the relations extracted from the past messages. Memory classes will be explained in a later lesson. In this example, we use this prompt just to extract relations from texts without leveraging a memory class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand the structure of the KNOWLEDGE_TRIPLE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT. This prompt is an instance of the PromptTemplate class with the input variable text. The template is a string that provides a few shot examples and instructions for the language model to follow when extracting knowledge triples from the input text. "
