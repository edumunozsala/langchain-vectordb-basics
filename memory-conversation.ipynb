    "In the ever-evolving world of chatbot applications, maintaining message history can be essential for delivering context-aware responses that enhance user experiences. In this article, we will dive into the realm of Python and LangChain and explore two exemplary scenarios that highlight the importance of message history tracking and how it can improve chatbot interactions.\n",

    "→This allows the model to remember both distant and recent interactions but may require more tweaking on what to summarize and what to maintain within the buffer window.\n",
