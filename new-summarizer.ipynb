    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's fast-paced world, it's essential to stay updated with the latest news and information. However, going through multiple news articles can be time-consuming. To help you save time and get a quick overview of the important points, let’s develop a News Articles Summarizer application using ChatGPT and LangChain. With this powerful tool, we can scrape online articles, extract their titles and text, and generate concise summaries. Within this lesson, we will walk you through the workflow of constructing a summarizer. We will employ the concepts we discussed in earlier lessons, demonstrating their application in a real-world scenario."

    "### And here are the steps described in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install required libraries: To get started, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: requests, newspaper3k, and langchain.\n",
    "- Scrape articles: Use the requests library to scrape the content of the target news articles from their respective URLs.\n",
    "- Extract titles and text: Employ the newspaper library to parse the scraped HTML and extract the titles and text of the articles.\n",
    "- Preprocess the text: Clean and preprocess the extracted texts to make them suitable for input to ChatGPT.\n",
    "- Generate summaries: Utilize ChatGPT to summarize the extracted articles' text concisely.\n",
    "- Output the results: Present the summaries along with the original titles, allowing users to grasp the main points of each article quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this workflow, you can create an efficient News Articles Summarizer that leverages ChatGPT to provide valuable insights in a time-saving manner. Stay informed without spending hours reading through lengthy articles, and enjoy the benefits of AI-powered summarization."

      "“We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,” wrote Meta in a blog post.\n",
